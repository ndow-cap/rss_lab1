Grains of the golden sand--
In a vision, or in none,
Is but a dream within a dream.
Is all that we see or seem
Is all that we see or seem
Them with a tighter clasp?
How few! yet how they creep
Thus much let me avow--
Take this kiss upon the brow!
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
While I weep--while I weep!
Is all that we see or seem
Is it therefore the less gone?
In a vision, or in none,
Is but a dream within a dream.
Is but a dream within a dream.
Is but a dream within a dream.
Is it therefore the less gone?
That my days have been a dream;
In a vision, or in none,
And I hold within my hand
