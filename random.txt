Grains of the golden sand--
In a vision, or in none,
You are not wrong, who deem
In a night, or in a day,
That my days have been a dream;
Is but a dream within a dream.
While I weep--while I weep!
Yet if hope has flown away
You are not wrong, who deem
Through my fingers to the deep,
Grains of the golden sand--
