You are not wrong, who deem
Of a surf-tormented shore,
All that we see or seem
How few! yet how they creep
Grains of the golden sand--
Through my fingers to the deep,
Is it therefore the less gone?
One from the pitiless wave?
Through my fingers to the deep,
Is all that we see or seem
You are not wrong, who deem
All that we see or seem
Thus much let me avow--
O God! can I not save
O God! can I not save
