Is but a dream within a dream.
Is all that we see or seem
Grains of the golden sand--
But a dream within a dream?
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Thus much let me avow--
One from the pitiless wave?
Is but a dream within a dream.
O God! can I not save
Is all that we see or seem
O God! can I not save
All that we see or seem
Through my fingers to the deep,
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Is it therefore the less gone?
And I hold within my hand
And, in parting from you now,
I stand amid the roar
Is but a dream within a dream.
All that we see or seem
That my days have been a dream;

And I hold within my hand
While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not save
