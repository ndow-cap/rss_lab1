Through my fingers to the deep,
Is but a dream within a dream.
All that we see or seem
Yet if hope has flown away
Yet if hope has flown away
And, in parting from you now,
While I weep--while I weep!
All that we see or seem
Take this kiss upon the brow!
All that we see or seem
Is it therefore the less gone?
Yet if hope has flown away
Through my fingers to the deep,
Them with a tighter clasp?
That my days have been a dream;
Of a surf-tormented shore,
All that we see or seem
